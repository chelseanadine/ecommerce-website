## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- "Keep Shopping" button needed to be updated, since no link to another page was provided when clicked

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- Initially came up with tasks in jekyll pages, however jekyll pages need serious reworking
- Completed tasks with standard .html pages which were mostly set up properly
- Must re-work jekyll completely for final site

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- Participants noted my layout could be more "fluid", "moving", add some depth to links and design
- I need to look over all my href links in my work to ensure they are working properly
- Participants noted that the "Buttons" page was slightly annoying in terms of accessibility, since VoiceOver states each item on the screen and moves the highlight box around
- Since it's just a sample page this won't be an issue on full site once developed
